 
Highly online study group needed.

Hi all, I'm Rae. I've got a wide variety of skills in a wide variety of topics, indluding full-stack web dev. I'm seeking a study group that can get together twice a week - preferably Tuesdays and Thursdays in the afternoon - to share study materials and do study group things.

I am a full time student pursuing a graduate degree. I ask that you please be: tolerant, respectful, and communicative.

Discord is a must for me.

I am already in group 2 on the discord server (https://discord.gg/66a5YRpe).

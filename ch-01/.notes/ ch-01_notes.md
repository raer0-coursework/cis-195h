## Notes

### Planning

- `Wireframe` is the visual outline of a website. Show content in abstract blocks for digestion when creating your website.
- `sitemapping` plan out the site with the wireframe. Map that sucker out. Map it good. Map it *real* good.
- [Linear](.assets/img/fig_1-13.png), [hierarchal](.assets/img/fig_1-14.png), and [webbed](.assets/img/fig_1-16.png) structures are all very common in modern web design. More complex websites will mix these structures. **personal note, univertse employed all these techniques.
- Simple, effective `graphics` help improve engagement and usability.
- Likewise, simple and effective `navigation` goes a long way for usability and engagement.
- Custom, well designed, legible `typography` assists in creating memorable, pleasing to look at pages.
- Use `color` appropriately, coordinating the pallette to the brand and desired image a website is trying to promote or achieve.
- Be sure to consider `accessibility` when designing webpages.
  - Take advantage of the accessibility features offered by HTML to provide disabled, or audio/visual impaired users a non-frustrating experience.
  - Always provide alternate text descriptions for images and graphics.
  - Tailor to locale when necessary, but avoid highly localized slang or common symbols which may have polar-opposite meanings depending on region.
  - In some instances, accessibility becomes a `legal requirement`. So, in the interest of best practice, consider accessibility at all times.

### HTML

- HTML is a markup language. It is a computer and human readable document format which can be used reliably and universally to display text and graphic-based content to users.
- HTML5 introduces several new tags which increase readability of code. For example: the nav, header, and footer tags allow us to more easily discern these type of elements, as opposed to encapuslating them one and all inside of divs.

#### Expanding HTML

- Javascript is the most popular way of expanding website functionality, while CSS expands website beauty. The introduction of NodeJS allows front and backend code to be written in the same language. I have my personal gripes with node, and prefer python for backend, but that's just me.
  - Javascript started out as just a client side scripting lang for browsers to do more useful stuff, and has evolved a lot.
  - jquery is a javascript library that aims to make it easier to implement certain things with javascript in an html site.
  - .asp or active server pages - we only need to know that this exists, is made by microsoft, and is ASS. booooo closed source. Boooooo.
- PHP is also very common, because it is designed to mix well with html. However, it is dangerous to have code that handles server functions be easily executable by a user. When visiting, say, index.php of a site, you're telling that site to execute code found in that file *directly*. It is very easy for an attacker to exploit PHP if the programmer is inexperienced, or simply makes a lame mistake.
